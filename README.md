# Star Rating

I built this WordPress plugin for simplistic demonstration on creating a Gutenberg block. Basically, it demonstrates how to create/code and register a simple Gutenberg block in WordPress allowing users to change its settings/behaviour and styles on demand.

The block is a star rating block where it allows the user to add a star rating widget into their content. The user can pick between 1-5 stars via a slider in the block inspector area and they can choose from 3 different star styles (full stars, outline stars and colored stars) using "block styles".

N.B. The version of the block inside the "assets/js" folder were already compiled/built through Webpack, thus, it looks gibberish. Check the "src" folder for the actual (uncompiled) source code instead.

Can be a good starting point for someone wanting to learn how to create and integrate a Gutenberg block into WordPress. Enjoy!
